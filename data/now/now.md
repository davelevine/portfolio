This is my [Now Page]: a brief update on what's currently happening in my life, inspired by [Derek Sivers].

## Personal

> **Update:** I finally got around to reading [The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy] by Douglas Adams. This is one I've had in my queue for some time now, and I'm glad I finally got around to it.

I've officially been in my house for 8 years now. Between that, my wife, and two kids, I have no problem staying busy. It’s hard to believe I’ve been working remotely for nearly 4.5 years, which allows me to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Watching my kids grow up so quickly has been both wonderful and surreal.

I’m currently reading [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] by Douglas Adams. This is one I've had in my queue for some time now, and I'm glad I finally got around to it. Once I finish, I'll be getting back to [Meditations] by Marcus Aurelius.

Also, I've been getting back into exercising after a prolonged hiatus. It's been great to prioritize my health and well-being again. Small steps, but I'm feeling better for it.

Whatever’s left of my spare time is spent:

* Updating my [portfolio] to showcase my latest projects and achievements.
* Building out my personal [knowledge base] with new content and resources.
* Managing and updating my [homelab], which is a constant yet rewarding project.

## Professional

I’ve been with [Weill Cornell Medicine] since October 2015, now working as a Solutions Engineer. This role allows me to blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving.

Lately, I’ve been focusing on:

* Refining application architecture to stay ahead of the curve.
* Helping our team work better together by simplifying processes and ensuring everyone’s on the same page.
* Working closely with others to design solutions that fit the organization's needs and make a difference in how we operate.
