As I mentioned in my first post, I'm working my way through the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification training course](https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-2019-associate-level/). I finished the EC2 Fundamentals course last night and just wanted to write some of my thoughts on it as I move onto the Intermediate coursework.

* EC2 as a whole is unbelievably daunting no matter how you look at it. I've only dipped my toe in the pool, and it's already apparent to me that this architecture is massive.

* This course is ultimately teaching me to look at system architecture differently â€” to break down an entire machine into tangible bits and fully understand the purpose of every part. A few examples...
  * EC2 instances are just base images without any attributes other than the defaults. Configuration is performed as necessary before or after an instance is created.
  * EBS volumes are just that... storage volumes. They can be attached and remove at will, the same way as hard drives.

Learning about system architecture this way is making me think differently about computing and what's possible.

I'll be moving onto the EC2 Intermediate training next. Although I'm nervous being one step closer to the exam, I'm also incredibly excited. I think that combination alone means I'm exactly where I need to be.
