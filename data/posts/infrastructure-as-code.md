## Summary

Over the last 3 months, I've been doing a significant restructuring of the way that I work in my homelab. It's not that there was anything wrong with it, per se, but rather that I wanted to challenge myself to do it better.

I'd been putting off learning Ansible for years, and life just seemed to have a way of bringing it up every now and then. I'd see something in a blog post, on Reddit, on YouTube, at work, etc. talking about how great it is. I knew this instinctively based on what I already knew about it, but I hadn't really gotten into the finer details yet.

Beyond knowing that I really needed to stop putting this off, I began to take stock of how much time I was putting into my homelab that I should've been putting into my family. I'd find myself playing with my kids, but my head would be thinking about different aspects of my homelab. All this did was just make me sad, and realize that something had to change.

## Ansible

Something that I often have a hard time with is just starting. There often never really feels like a good time to do anything, and I know I'm not alone in this. I did a casual look around on YouTube for some sort of tutorials to get me going. I'd heard that [Jeff Geerling's Ansible 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN) course was fantastic so I started there. Personally, I couldn't get into it for some reason. It's not a dig against the course itself, but lets just say it wasn't for me.

I looked for a different course and found the [Getting Started with Ansible](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKEUHie1m24-wkyHpEsa4Y70&si=kemKLmTPirXDCgKN) course from Learn Linux TV and that was it for me. I finished the course in a few days and I already felt like I had a good foundation.
