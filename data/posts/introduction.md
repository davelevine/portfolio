First and foremost, I'm Dave. Rather than a formal introduction, [click here](/about) instead to learn about me.

I'm not entirely sure what I plan on writing in this, or if I even plan on keeping it. It's more of a spur of the moment thing to do, especially since I've never really had any interest in creating or maintaining a blog.

In any case, I'll get right into it...

Right now, I'm at a bit of a professional crossroads. I've gotten to a point in my career where I have enough skin in the game to be considered expensive, but I don't have enough of a proven track record to be considered in-demand.

This unfortunately sucks. So instead of complaining, what do I do about it?

The answer â€” learn something new!

In comes AWS, or should I say, AWS training.

I've looked at my professional skillset and found that the best path forward would be to obtain the AWS Certified Solutions Architect: Associate certification.

Aside from just being a certification I can get to bolster my resume and hopefully get my foot in the right door(s), it's incredibly interesting. I have a fair bit of knowledge when it comes to working with distributed systems, considering my entire homelab consists of them, so this is just applying that knowledge to an exponentially larger platform! No pressure...

That's fine though; I'm not afraid of it, although I will admit the nickel and dime billing model they have is pretty intimidating!

This is an interesting leap for me, because I haven't been this excited to learn something new in a long time. I keep myself busy by finding seemingly random projects across GitHub, Docker Hub, etc and integrating them into my existing setup. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what I can accomplish, so why should this be any different?

Should I decide to keep this blog, much of the content will likely be what I'm learning, my frustrations with it, and so on. I hope to also write about projects I'm currently working on, along with ones that are completed.

I've already written more than I imagined I would for a first post. I think that's enough for tonight, but I have a feeling I'll be back for more.

Stay tuned.
