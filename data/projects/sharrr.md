## Description

This project is proof-of-concept on how to transfer large files over the internet asynchronously and in the most secure way possible, using zero-knowledge encryption.

Original project can be found at [sharrr.com].

## Key Takeaways

- [End-to-end encrypted] file transfer
- Parallel [upload]
- Support for extra large files (_Technically_ there is no file size limit)
- One-time [download] link
- 7 day retention period (Download link expires and files are automatically deleted afterwards.)
