## Description

A knowledge base I started in 2016. It has since amassed to hundreds of articles, guides and documents that serve as a source of truth, second brain and a labor of love. The site was initially created to provide me with a better understanding of the projects I was working on at the time. It now serves as a container for all of my life projects.
