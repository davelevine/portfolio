This is a [now page]: a brief update of what's currently happening in my life.

## Personal

Living on Long Island with my wife and two kids. Remote work has been my routine for nearly 4.5 years.

Currently reading [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less] by Greg McKeown

In my spare time, I focus on:

* Updating my [portfolio]
* Building out my personal [knowledge base]
* Managing and updating my [homelab]

## Professional

I've been with [Weill Cornell Medicine] since October 2015, now working as a Solutions Engineer.

## Changelog

* **2024.08.09**: Initial creation of the Now page.
