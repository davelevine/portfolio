This is a [now page]: a brief update of what's currently happening in my life.

## Personal

I'm still living on Long Island with my wife and two kids. Remote work has been my routine for nearly 4.5 years, which allows me to have a healthy balance of work and family life.

I'm currently reading [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less] by Greg McKeown

In my spare time, I focus on:

* Updating my [portfolio] to reflect my latest projects and achievements.
* Building out my personal [knowledge base] with new content and resources.
* Managing and updating my [homelab].

## Professional

I've been with [Weill Cornell Medicine] since October 2015, now working as a Solutions Engineer. This role allows me to blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving.

## Changelog

* **August 09, 2024**: Initial creation of the Now page.
